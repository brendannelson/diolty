                Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. The
                plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use
                it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… I suggest you try it again, Luke.
                <strong> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</strong> <em> Don't
                    underestimate the Force.</em> You mean it controls your actions?

                He is here. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Leave
                that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I need your
                help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

                I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's
                nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I find your lack of faith
                disturbing.

                I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. But with
                the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with
                him.

            <p>
                I find your lack of faith disturbing. Red Five standing by. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy
                to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's
                one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my
                destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
