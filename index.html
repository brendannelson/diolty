                Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever
                you're going. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Kid, I've flown from one side of this
                galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe
                there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my
                destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

                Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. The plans
                you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Your eyes can deceive you. <strong> Don't trust
                    them.</strong> <em> I have traced the Rebel spies to her.</em> Now she is my only link to finding
                their secret base.

            <p>
                Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I
                supposed to fight? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

            <ol>
                <li>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission
                    to Alderaan--</li>
                <li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>
